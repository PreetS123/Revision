     1. to create branch ---> git branch practice
     2. to switch newly created branch --> git checkout practice

     Q). What is diff b/w Git and Github?
     ans-  Git: Git is a distributed version control system for tracking
     changes in source code during software development. It is designed
     for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track
     changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity,
     and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
     GitHub: GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which
     offers all of the distributed revision control and source code
     management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own
     features.

Q). What are Unit Testing?
ans-->  Unit testing is the first level of testing done before integration testing.
Unit testing is such a type of testing technique that is usually performed by
developers. Although due to the reluctance of developers to test, quality
assurance engineers also do unit testing.
Objective of Unit Testing:-
-----------------------------
The objective of Unit Testing is:
To isolate a section of code.
To verify the correctness of the code.
To test every function and procedure.
To fix bugs early in the development cycle and to save costs.
To help the developers to understand the code base and enable them to make changes quickly.
To help with code reuse.
