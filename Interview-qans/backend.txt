      Q2.What is node.js?
        Node.js is an open-sourse backend , javaScript runt-time environment.
        Node.js is written on C,C++, and javaScript.
        Node.js helps javaScript to run outside the browser.
        Node.js is mostly used for server-side web development.
        Node.js is scalable, light-weight and effecient in nature.

      Q3.List down the major benefits of using Node.js?
      1. It is very simple to learn and run.
      2. It is used to run asynchronous programming.
      3. It is higly scalable in natue.
      4. It is single threaded.
      
      When to use Node.js?
      1.real-time-application.
      2. where scalability is at higher priority.
      3.Collabrative tools
      4. Data Streaming application

      Q4. Why node.js is single threaded?
      Node.js is single threaded in order to perform asynchronous programming.
      With asynchronous processing , an application can perform better and is more scalable under web loads.

      Q5. How do Node.js works?

      It works on single threaded event loop and a non blocking I/O which provides high rate as it can handle 
      higher number of concurrent request.
      By making use of 'HTTP' module, Node.js can run on any stand-alone web server.

      Non-blocking I/o: Non-blocking i/o  means working with multiple requests without blocking the thread for a single request. 
      I/O basically interacts with external systems such as files, databases.
       Node.js is not used for CPU-intensive work means for calculations, video processing because a single thread cannot handle the CPU works.

       Asynchronous: Asynchronous is executing a callback function. 
       The moment we get the response from the other server or database it will execute a callback function.
        Callback functions are called as soon as some work is finished and this is because the node.js uses an event-driven architecture. 
       The single thread doesn’t work with the request instead it sends the request
        to another system which resolves the request and it is accessible for another request.

        Event loop: The event loop contains a single thread and is responsible for handling easy tasks like executing callbacks and network I/O.
         When the program is to initialize all the top-level code is executed, the code is not in the callback function.
          All the applications code that is inside callback functions will run in the event loop.
         EventLoop is the heart of node.js.
          When we start our node application the event loop starts running right away.
           Most of the work is done in the event loop.

           Thread pool: Though node.js is single-threaded it internally maintains a thread pool. 
           When non-blocking requests are accepted there are processed in an event loop, 
           but while accepting blocking requests it checks for available threads in a thread pool,
            assigns a thread to the client’s request which is then processed and send back to the event loop, 
            and response is sent to the respective client.

      Q6.Where Node.js can be used?
       1. Real-Time Web Applications
       2. Distributed System.
       3. Network application 
       4. General purpose application.

       Q7. How many types of API functions are there in Node.js?
        There are two types of API functions in Node.js:
        Asynchronous, non-blocking functions.
        Synchronous, blocking functions.

      Q8. What is the difference between Asynchronous and Non-blocking?
         
         Asynchronous-----> Using these we can make asynchronous HTTP request that do not 
                                wait for the server to respond.
                           These functions continue to respond to the request for which 
                               it has already received the server response.

         Non-Blocking ------> NOn blocking functions are used in regards with I/O operations.
                              They immediatly respond with whatever data is available and
                                  keeps on running as per the request.


      Q9. What is package.json?
          It is basically the manifest file that contains the metaData of the project
           where we define the properties of a pacakage.


      Q10. Explain the concepts of URL module.
        The URL module in node.js provides various utilities for URL resolutions and parsing.
        It is a built-in module that helps in splitting up the web address into a readable format.
        
        What is the difference between Blocking and Non-Blocking in Node.js?
        Blocking---> It refers to the blocking of further operations until the current operation is finished.
                     It get executed synchronously means that the code would be executed line by line.
                     In it programm wait until the called function or operation returns.

        Non-Blocking-----> It doesn’t block the execution of further operation.
                            Here program get executed asynchronously means that the program mynot execute line by line.
                            In it programm calls the function and move to the nexxt operation that doesn’t wait for the previous function to return.
                                
      
    Q11. What is a difference between framework and library?
    Ans--> 
    FrameWork--->1.It comprises of lot of APIs, compilers, support programs, libraries etc.
                 2.It is difficult to replace frameworks.
                 3.A framework development requires a lot of code that decrese
                    performance and increase the load time.
                  4.Including framework smoothly into an existing project is impossible.
                 5. Its example are AngularJS, Spring, NodeJS, etc.
    
    Library---> 1.It is a collection of helper modules , classes , objects , functions , pre-written code , etc.
                2. A library is easy to be replaced with another library.
                3.Building a library requires less code , so there is better performance and fast load time.
                4. Libraries can be integrated easily into existing projects to add some specific functionality.
                5.Its example are JQuery , React JS , etc. 

                    /////////////////////////////  Express   ////////////////////////////////

                    Express is fast and essential web framework of Node.Js. We can assume express as a layer
                    built on the top of the Node.js that helps manage a server and routes. It provides a
                     robust set of features to devlop web and mobile application.

       Express.js is a small framework that works on top of Node.js web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features.
       It makes it easier to organize your application’s functionality with middleware and routing.
       It adds helpful utilities to Node.js HTTP objects and facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.



  


/////////////////////////////////Interview bit Q/Ans /////////////////////////////////////
What is node.js?
Node.js is a virtual machine that uses JavaScript as its scripting language.
It basically runs on chrome V8 javaScript language.
Node.js is based on an event-driven architecture where I/O runs asynchronously 
making it lightweight and efficient. 
It is being used in developing server side web application.


What is difference between a Node.js and JavaScript ?

Node.js--->It is used to perform non blocking activities.
          It is used as a scripting language  using interpreter.

JavaScript---> For general client side operations.
               It is used in programming language.


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

 Why is Node.js single-threaded?
 Node.js was created explicitly as an experiment in async processing.
 This was to try a new theory of doing async processing on a single thread 
 over the existing thread-based implementation of scalling via different framework.

 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 How do you manage packages in your node.js project?
 Generally we use npm to manage a number of package installers.
 To maintain versions of libs being installed in a projects we use package.json and package-lock.json
 so that there is no issue in porting that app into different environment.

 ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 What is REPL?
 read,eval.print,loop which further mean evaluating the code and go on.
 It is also known as node-shell in javaScript.

 ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 What is the purpose of module.exports?
 This is used to expose functions of a particular module or file to be used elsewhere in the projects.

 ///////////////////////////////////////////////////
 What are node.js streams?
 Streams are instances of EventEmmitter which can be used to work with streaming data in node.js.
 There are mainly four types of the stream:
 Writable:streams to which data con be read.(fs.createWriteStream())
 Readable:streams from which data can be read.(fs.createReadStream())
 Duplex:streams that both Readable and Writable.(net.Socket)
 Transform: Duplex streams that can be modify or transform the data as it is written and read.(zlib.createDeflate())

 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 What are node.js buffers?
 In general, buffers is a temporary memory that is mainly used by stream to hold on some data until consumed.

 /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  What is middleware?

  It is basically a function between request and responce with a certain logic to execute the next function.
