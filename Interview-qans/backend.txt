     Q1.Difference between node.js and javaScript ?
      JavaScript---->1. It is a scripting language.
                      2.Used for client side activity for a web application.
                      

      Node.js------>1. Node.js is a interpretor and environment for javaScript.
                    2. It is used for accessing or performing any non-blocking
                       operation of any operating system.

      Q2.What is node.js?
      Node.js provides a runtime environment for javaScript.
      It basically runs on chrome V8 j.
      It is an event driven language which runs asynchrounsly making node.js light-weight  and efficient.
      It is used for making server-side web application and it uses many different frameworks.
      Node.js is suitable for something which is faster and more scalable is required.
      It is being used in developing application for reading, writing ,etc synchronously and asynchronously.


      Q3.List down the major benefits of using Node.js?
      It is very simple to run.
      It is used to run asynchronous programming.
      It is higly scalable in natue.
      It is single threaded.

      Q4. Why node.js is single threaded?
      Node.js is single threaded in order to perform asynchronous programming.
      With asynchronous processing , an application can perform better and is more scalable under web loads.

      Q5. How do Node.js works?
      Node.js is a virtual machine that uses javaScript as its scripting language and runs on the v8 version of chrome.
      It works on single threaded event loop and a non blocking I/O which provides high rate as it can handle 
      higher number of concurrent request.
      By making use of 'HTTP' module, Node.js can run on any stand-alone web server.

      Q6.Where Node.js can be used?
       1. Real-Time Web Applications
       2. Distributed System.
       3. Network application 
       4. General purpose application.

       Q7. How many types of API functions are there in Node.js?
        There are two types of API functions in Node.js:
        Asynchronous, non-blocking functions.
        Synchronous, blocking functions.

      Q8. What is the difference between Asynchronous and Non-blocking?
         
         Asynchronous-----> Using these we can make asynchronous HTTP request that do not 
                                wait for the server to respond.
                           These functions continue to respond to the request for which 
                               it has already received the server response.

         Non-Blocking ------> NOn blocking functions are used in regards with I/O operations.
                              They immediatly respond with whatever data is available and
                                  keeps on running as per the request.


      Q9. What is package.json?
          It is basically the manifest file that contains the metaData of the project
           where we define the properties of a pacakage.


      Q10. Explain the concepts of URL module.
        The URL module in node.js provides various utilities for URL resolutions and parsing.
        It is a built-in module that helps in splitting up the web address into a readable format.
        
                                
      






/////////////////////////////////Interview bit Q/Ans /////////////////////////////////////
What is node.js?
Node.js is a virtual machine that uses JavaScript as its scripting language.
It basically runs on chrome V8 javaScript language.
Node.js is based on an event-driven architecture where I/O runs asynchronously 
making it lightweight and efficient. 
It is being used in developing application.

What is difference between a Node.js and JavaScript ?

Node.js--->It is used to perform non blocking activities.
          It is used as a scripting language  using interpreter.

JavaScript---> For general client side operations.
               It is used in programming language.


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

 Why is Node.js single-threaded?
 Node.js was created explicitly as an experiment in async processing.
 This was to try a new theory of doing async processing on a single thread 
 over the existing thread-based implementation of scalling via different framework.

 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 How do you manage packages in your node.js project?
 Generally we use npm to manage a number of package installers.
 To maintain versions of libs being installed in a projects we use package.json and package-lock.json
 so that there is no issue in porting that app into different environment.

 ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 What is REPL?
 read,eval.print,loop which further mean evaluating the code and go on.
 It is also known as node-shell in javaScript.

 ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 What is the purpose of module.exports?
 This is used to expose functions of a particular module or file to be used elsewhere in the projects.

 ///////////////////////////////////////////////////
 What are node.js streams?
 Streams are instances of EventEmmitter which can be used to work with streaming data in node.js.
 There are mainly four types of the stream:
 Writable:streams to which data con be read.(fs.createWriteStream())
 Readable:streams from which data can be read.(fs.createReadStream())
 Duplex:streams that both Readable and Writable.(net.Socket)
 Transform: Duplex streams that can be modify or transform the data as it is written and read.(zlib.createDeflate())

 ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 What are node.js buffers?
 In general, buffers is a temporary memory that is mainly used by stream to hold on some data until consumed.

 /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
  What is middleware?

  It is basically a function between request and responce with a certain logic to execute the next function.
