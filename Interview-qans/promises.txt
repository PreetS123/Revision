What is asynchronous method in javaScript?
It is a behaviour of javaScript to handle functions that takes time in javaScript.
 Asynchronous code allows the program to be executed immediately where the synchronous code
 block further execution of the remaining code until it finishes the current one.


First Method to handle asynchronous method in javaScript:
 Q) What is Promises in javaScript?

Promises are object in javaScript that returns single output as per the condition fullfilled or rejected.
It is generally used for handling of asynchronous nature of javaScript.
It has three scope
 a) Promised
 b) fullfilled
 c) rejected


 Syntax:-
        var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
          const x = "geeksforgeeks";
          const y = "geeksforgeeks"
          if(x === y) {          
	          resolve();
          } else {          
	          reject();
          }
          });
          
          promise.
          	then(function () {
          		console.log('Success, You are a GEEK');
          	}).
          	catch(function () {
          		console.log('Some error has occurred');
          	});



  1. Purpose of  . then() method ?
       .then() is invoked when a promise is either resolved or rejected.
       It may also be defined as a career which takes data from promise and further executes it successfully.


  2.Purpose of .catch()  method ?

 catch() is invoked when a promise is either rejected or some error has occurred in execution.
 It is used as an Error Handler whenever at any step there is a chance of getting an error.


 Second Method to handle Asynchronous function:
  Q) What is async/await ?

  It is an easier way of writting  promise in javaScript.
  Writting async before a function turns that function into a promise.
  Await is always used with async function.
  awaits help us to wait for the promise to be fullfilled.

  Async--> Async functions will always return a value.
   Async function makes sure that a promise is returned 
   and if it is not returned then JavaScript automatically wraps
    it in a promise which is resolved with its value.

     const getData = async() => {
	    var data = "Hello World";
	     return data;
      }
   getData().then(data => console.log(data));
   output:
   Hello World

   Await: Await function is used to wait for the promise.
          It is used within the async block only. 
          It makes the code wait until the promise returns a result.
          It only makes the async block wait.

          const getData = async() => {
	      var y = await "Hello World";
	      console.log(y);
        }

            console.log(1);
            getData();
            console.log(2);
Output:
1
2
Hello World



Third way to improve handleing of asynchronous function 

What is try catch ?
 Try catch is a statment where try and catch block is being executed.
 Firstly try block is being executed and if there is some exception then catch block gets executed.
Its an efficient way of writting async await function. and also for error handling.
